Simple climate and cryosphere models in MatLab

MarineIceSheetModel.m: Analytical steady state solution of a 1d marine ice sheet following Schoof (2007), extended with an analytical profile of a steady-state ice shelf. Each set of parameters results in a steady-state ice sheet geometry. The model can be forced by either changes in sea level (it lowers or rises the bedrock) or mean surface mass balance. The model comes with two bed profiles, a linearly downward sloping bed and a overdeepened bed. The latter exhibits hysteresis. Besides the ice sheet geometry, other panels show ice flux and the phase space between the forcing variable and grounding line position.
